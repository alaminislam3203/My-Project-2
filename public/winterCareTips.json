    "question": "Should pets wear sweaters or jackets in winter?",
    "answer": "Yes! Especially for small breeds or pets with short fur, sweaters and jackets help retain body heat. Always choose one that fits snugly but not too tight. Avoid leaving wet clothing on your pet, as it can make them colder. Layering light clothing can be effective for extremely cold days. Ensure the clothing does not restrict movement or irritate the skin."
